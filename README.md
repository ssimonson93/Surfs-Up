# Overview of Analysis
This project was conducted in order to determine if the weather in Hawaii will be viable for opening a surfing and ice cream store.  An investor is ready to provide backing for the venture, but had a similar investment go awry due to too much rainy weather in the area.  The data set provided by the investor was analyzed using Pandas and SQLalchemy to explore factors such as precipitation and temperature during certain months of the year to see whether the climate will be conducive enough to opening a surfing and ice cream store.

# Results
The following information was found upon analyzing the temperatures from the dataset in the months of June and December
* The mean temperature during the month of June is 75 degrees, while the mean temperature in December is 71 degrees.
* The minimum temperature during the month of June is 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees.
* The maximum temperature during the month of June is 85 degrees, while the maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees.

# Summary
The temperature statistics for the months of June and December imply the climate is largely the same throughout the year.  December is colder, but only by 4 degrees on average, and temperatures still reach up to 83 degrees at a maximum.  The minimum temperature of 56 degrees in December may be a deterrent to surfing and ice cream, however the mean of 71 shows itâ€™s not as common for the weather to be so cold.  Ultimately, from this information, it seems possible to run a surfing and ice cream store in this area.
To further analyze how well this store can do in this weather, one query could be performed to see the precipitation amounts in June, as well as another query to see the precipitation amounts in December.  Because the investor cites their previous venture failed due to rain, this would likely be valuable information to help confirm if Oahu is the right place for the store.
